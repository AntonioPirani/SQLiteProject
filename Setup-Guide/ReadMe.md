## Download
The first thin to do in order to set up a SQLite Database is to get a copy of the prebuilt binaries for your machine, or get a copy 
of the sources and compile them yourself. Be careful to download the correct files for your system if using prebuilt binaries. All 
downloads can be found [here](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html).
